Intel Unnati Industrial Training â€“ Summer 2023 Project: Smart Mobile Phone Price Prediction using Machine Learning by Team Alpha Debuggers

Our code is the Final_Code.ipynb file in the 'Code' Folder. The Requirements.txt file can be found there as well. 
Also, the dataset (MobilePhonePrice.csv) can be found in the data folder which can be uploaded to the code for execution. We did our code in Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xnQogeiTJ8j6kcxsNtnUceSVVrIgJLUc?usp=sharing).
